If I wanted that when a customer is deleted / later anything is deleted all deleted data will store in other database. Is it possible?

Yes, it's possible to store deleted data in another database or another location before deletion in Django. This involves capturing the data before it's removed from the primary database.

One approach is to create a secondary database specifically for storing deleted data or a backup. You can create models that mirror the structure of the models you want to track for deletion, and then upon deletion in the primary database, save a copy of the data in the secondary database.

Here's an example of how you might implement this concept:

Assuming you have a separate app named DeletedDataApp for handling deleted data:

models.py (in the app for storing deleted data):

python
Copy code
from django.db import models

class DeletedUserProfile(models.Model):
    # Mirror the fields of UserProfile to store deleted data
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    # Add other fields you want to track upon deletion

    # Add a field to record the deletion timestamp or any relevant information
    deleted_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    # Add methods or fields for any additional information you want to store

    # Example method to create a deleted record from a UserProfile instance
    @classmethod
    def create_from_user_profile(cls, user_profile):
        deleted_user_profile = cls(
            first_name=user_profile.user.first_name,
            last_name=user_profile.user.last_name,
            # Copy other fields from the user profile you want to track
        )
        deleted_user_profile.save()
        return deleted_user_profile
views.py (in the main app where deletion occurs):

python
Copy code
from .models import UserProfile
from DeletedDataApp.models import DeletedUserProfile

@login_required
def delete_customer(request, customer_id):
    customer = get_object_or_404(UserProfile, id=customer_id)

    # Capture data before deletion
    deleted_data = DeletedUserProfile.create_from_user_profile(customer)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        customer.user.delete()  # Delete the associated User object

        # Optionally, you can also save the deleted_data instance to another database or location

        messages.success(request, 'Customer deleted successfully!')
        return redirect('see_all_customers')  # Redirect after successful deletion

    return render(request, 'delete_customer.html', {'customer': customer})
Explanation:

The DeletedUserProfile model in the DeletedDataApp mirrors the fields of UserProfile to store deleted data.
In the delete_customer view, before deleting the customer's data, a copy of the data is created as DeletedUserProfile using the create_from_user_profile method.
Upon deletion, the associated user is deleted from the primary database, and the data is also saved in the DeletedUserProfile model in the secondary database (you need to adjust this as per your specific storage requirements).
Remember to properly configure database connections and access permissions for the secondary database, and adjust the model fields and methods based on the data you want to capture before deletion.
